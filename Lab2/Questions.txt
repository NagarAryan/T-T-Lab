1- “Guess the Number ” we first have to import the random module from python’s inbuilt libraries. This module 
will be used in selecting a number between a defined set or range. We now need to select a range between which the user is to guess a number. To do this, the user inputs a number; a lower limit and an upper limit.After getting the upper limit and the lower limit within which a random number will be selected, we pick a random number using a function from the random module.
The user is then assigned a number of chances to guess a number which will be a counter for a loop. We use a 
while loop since the user can get the right guess at any trial. The while case will check if the user has 
guessed the right number and if so, exits the loop. If not the number of chances decrements by one until the 
user has no more chances and the random number is revealed to him. To ensure that the program runs continuously
 and doesn’t close the program window, we add a true statement and print a line to separate the blocks.

2-Python script to generate a random password of 12 characters, Each time the program is run, a new password 
will be generated randomly.The passwords generated will be 12 characters long and will have to include the 
following characters in any order: 3 uppercase letters from A to Z, 3 lowercase letters from a to z, 3 digits 
from 0 to 9, 3 punctuation signs such as !, ?, “, # etc.
